# Emily's Blog

This project was made for the purpose of housing my own blog. Since I learned Ruby, the most obvious use case for me is a blog. I wanted visitors to be able to visit my website and be linked to my blog, and I knew I could build such a thing, so I did.

## How to Start this project (even though it's hosted on herokuapp)

run $ bundle install
run $ rails s

navigate to http://localhost:3000/ on your browser.
